# Wew Family Messaging — Opt-In Consent

## Program Description
Wew Family Messaging provides children with a safe, parent-controlled phone number for sending and receiving SMS/MMS messages with approved contacts. Parents/guardians manage participation and monitor usage. Messages are conversational only (no marketing, no automated promotions).

## Opt-In Process
- Parents/guardians invite their child and add approved contacts.  
- Approved contacts receive an invitation explaining that the child’s messages will come from a dedicated toll-free number.  
- By replying to the first message or sending a message to the child’s toll-free number, the contact explicitly opts in to receive conversational messages.

## Message Types
- Peer-to-peer conversational texts (SMS/MMS) between the child and their approved contacts.  
- Administrative messages related to safety controls (e.g., “This number is temporarily in quiet mode”).  
- No promotional or marketing content.

## Frequency
Low volume, child-initiated, conversational texting only. Expected fewer than 500 messages per day total.

## Opt-Out Instructions
- Contacts may text **STOP** at any time to stop receiving messages.  
- Contacts may text **START** to re-enable messages.  
- Contacts may text **HELP** for support information.  

## Support
For assistance, contacts can reply **HELP** or reach the parent/guardian directly.

## Consent Recordkeeping
- Parent/guardian maintains a record of approved contacts.  
- Approved contacts initiate conversation by sending a message to the toll-free number, serving as explicit opt-in.  
- Logs are retained in the Wew backend to demonstrate compliance.
